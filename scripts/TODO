1. Remove the hard-coded "rountree" username.
2. Instead of the user owning /dev and /sys files, create a group and modify permissions accordingly.
3. The first time the script does a "git clone" it asks about whether the remote address should be trusted.
   Figure out a way of removing that check.
4. FIXED:  Openssl man pages are not getting installed.  Installed libssl-dev and libssl-doc.
